Kubernetes enables unlimited horizontal scalability by enabling the distribution of the application's business logic across hundreds or even thousands of microservices. 

## The New Internal API Layer

Comparing to the older Monolith, huge portions of the codebase that represent the public interfaces (aka public methods) are replaced by the Microservice Communication layer. The Microservice Communication layer has several names like Internal APIs or East-West APIs.

**New internal API layer has exponentially more APIs, compared to external APIs.**

Due to Kuberentesâ€™ distributed and dynamic nature, new protocols and service mesh technologies, tracking internal APIs is highly challenging, making it harder to troubleshoot and protect.

While anyone can `ssh` into a Pod, use `TCPdump` to  capture traffic into a PCAP file, use `kubectl cp` to copy the PCAP file to their machine and use Wireshark to view, Kubernetes makes it more challanging by distributing the traffic across hundreds of such pods that are dynamically started and stopped. 

## All Traffic Where and When Ever It Happens

Think of Kubeshark as automating the traffic capture process across all Pods and instantely presenting the disected traffic in a Web UI (or PCAP). 

Kubeshark, not only saves you time, it gives you access to all traffic whereever it happens and whenever it happens. 

This can be good news for API troublshooting, monitoring and protection.
