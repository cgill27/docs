#### Built to Run on Large Scale Production Clusters

Kubeshark was built to run on large scale production clusters. With a distributed architecture that promises a very low CPU and network overheads and capable of processing significantly amounts of traffic.

Kubeshark consists of four different software elements that work together harmoniously; **CLI**, **Hub**, **Worker** and the **Web UI**.

NOTE: Some of the protocols illustrated in the diagram (e.g. DNS, FTP) represent future roadmap items. The [Protocols](/en/protocol) section includes the complete list of supported protocol implementations.

## CLI

The **CLI** (Command Line Interface) is a binary distribution of the Kubeshark client and it is written in [Go](https://go.dev/) language. 

The **CLI** communicates with the [Kubernetes API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/) to deploy of the **Hub** in the cluster.

NOTE: Read more in the [CLI](/en/cli) section.

## Hub

The **Hub** is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image which is deployed into the Kubernetes cluster as a normal pod. The **Hub** has several functions:
- Orchestrates the **Workers** deployments and communicates with them through [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
- Receives the dissected traffic from the **Workers**
- Serves a web interface 

**FUTURE:** The **Hub** can be [deployed](/en/install#deploy) directly into the cluster using the `kubeshark deploy` command.

**Source code:** [`kubeshark/hub`](https://github.com/kubeshark/hub)

## Worker

**Workers** are responsible for capturing traffic, storing the captured traffic locally at the Kubernetes Clusterâ€™s Node level and dissecting the traffic upon request. 

The **Worker** is a Docker image which is deployed into your cluster as a [DaemonSet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/) to ensure Kubeshark can capture traffic at the node level.

The **Worker** contains the implementations of network sniffer, kernel tracing and more.
**Workers** transmit the disected traffic to the **Hub** via a WebSocket.

### CPU Intensive Operations Distribution

CPU intensive operations of traffic dissection are distributed and occur on-demand by the Workers at the Node level.

### Distributed Storage

Kubeshark **Workers** store the captured traffic locally at the Node level with no limit other than the limit of the volumes attached to the Nodes.

### Low Network Overhead

To reduce potential network overhead, only a fraction of the traffic is sent over the network upon request.

**FUTURE:** The **Worker** can be used as a network sniffer on your computer without requiring a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster.

**Source code:** [`kubeshark/worker`](https://github.com/kubeshark/worker)

## The Web UI

The Web UI is made out a [React](https://reactjs.org/) application and communicates via a websocket with the **Hub**. The Web UI displays the captured traffic in a browser.
