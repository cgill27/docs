## Distributed PCAP Storage

At its core, Kubesharkâ€™s architecture is based on distributed PCAP storage, limited only by the size of the sum of all volumes attached to all of the Nodes as each Worker stores the captured traffic at the Node level and in PCAP format.

### Why PCAP
PCAP provides all packet information from the Ethernet header all the way to the application payload, providing full visibility of the application and network interaction, pre- and post-event.

## Export to PCAP

Kubeshark enables to export any query result to a PCAP file that can be downloaded using the PCAP button that can be found just right to the query box (section A).

The PCAP export operation downloads a tar.gz file that includes the PCAP file and file named: name_resolution_history.json that helps map dynamically changing IPs to service names.

NOTE: when dealing with large amount of traffic, this operation can take a few seconds to complete.

## View PCAP

Kubeshark also provides a CLI option to view a previously exprted PCAP file. 

```shell
kubeshark tap --pcap <pcap-file-name.pcap.tar.gz>
```

Running the above command will open a local browser window using Kubeshark's Web UI to present the content of the PCAP file.
