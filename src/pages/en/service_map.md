**Kubeshark** offers a **Service Dependency Graph** to display your Kubernetes cluster.

The Service Map is quite sophisticated and updates as traffic is streaming in. If you have a lot of traffic, the image can be jumpy. If you'd like to view the service dependencies of a traffic snapshot, simply pause the streaming.

To view the **Service Map** click on the Service Map button in the upper right hand corner.
