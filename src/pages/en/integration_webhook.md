A webhook helper enables uploading anything to anywhere as long as webhooks are supported. It does an HTTP request to the WebHook (the HTTP endpoint) thatâ€™s defined by HTTP method and URL in the url argument with the HTTP body as the string in the body argument.

The following example calls a webhook for each health check:
```bash
function onItemCaptured(data) {
  console.log(data.request.path);
  if (data.request.path === "/health")
    vendor.webhook("POST", env.WEBHOOK_URL, data);
}
```
